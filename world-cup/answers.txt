Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: yes after 100000, some teams had a 0% chance of winning which is not correct

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: after 1000 i would say the simulation is good enough and it doesnt take a lot more time that 100 but more accurate
